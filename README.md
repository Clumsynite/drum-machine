# Drum Machine

Plays audio depending on the key you press. Supports Keyboard activity.

Another one of my [FCC projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).

Here is the one made in [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ClumsyKnight/full/oNbVPYv), for FCC's Fontend Libraries Certification.

The only thing different is this drum machine's mobile repsonse.
